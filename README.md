# Short description of the problem solved
The big topic is health-related, from the perspective of life expectancy, mortality in different age groups, and cause of death and its relations to income groups, regions, and health expenditures. Our work is based on two previous publications which are listed below:

## Data source:
1. Global cause of death 
API:https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death   
2. Health expenditure: 
API: GHO OData API 
3. Country income group, Country Region, Mortality categories,
World Bank Country and Lending Groups
Global health estimates: Leading causes of death

## Hypothesis
H1:Do the Global patterns of mortality by income group all over the world aligned with the previous work? (Patterns: i.e., Trend of mortality/ Cause Distribution/ Leading cause of death

H2:As in Sub-Saharan Africa, we expect health expenditure to exert a positive and significant impact on all three health outcomes (life expectancy, under-five mortality, and maternal mortality), for other regions globally. (1996-2015)
